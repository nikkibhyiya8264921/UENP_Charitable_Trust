- **JSON-Based Data Handling**: Storing images, URLs, and textual data in a JSON file system.
- **Image Sliders & Galleries**: Showcasing NGO activities dynamically.
- **Contact Section**: Email, mobile number, and address with interactive UI.
- **Indian Cultural Aesthetic**: Designed to connect deeply with the Indian audience.

## Tech Stack
